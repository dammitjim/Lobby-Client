# as of yet untitled twitch player

The aim here is to create a native twitch.tv player that has a ton of features that I have yet to define.

Also an excuse to mess about with Electron and React/Redux.

## TODO

* Come up with a cool hipster name for the app
* Clean up package.json before going any further now that it's somewhat working
* Distill gulpfile down to what's actually needed
* CSS/Sass folder structure (Are we SMACSSing this bitch?)
* Embedded twitch streams
* Channel list per game
* Multiple embedded streams
* Chat
* Load users follow list, show followed channel status in native menu
* Notifications when followed users start streaming
