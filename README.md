# as of yet untitled twitch player [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jimah/ElectronTwitchPrototype.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jimah/ElectronTwitchPrototype)

The aim here is to create a "native" twitch.tv player that has a ton of features that I have yet to define.

Also an excuse to mess about with Electron and React/Redux.

## TODO

* Come up with a cool hipster name for the app
* CSS/Sass folder structure (Are we SMACSSing this bitch?)
* Embedded twitch streams
* Channel list per game
* Multiple embedded streams
* Chat
* Load users follow list, show followed channel status in native menu
* Notifications when followed users start streaming
